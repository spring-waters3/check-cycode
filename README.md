### Security Finding: Overly Permissive Repository Creation Permissions

- **Description**: As a regular member of the "spring-waters" organization, I have the ability to create repositories. This permission is overly permissive and can lead to uncontrolled repository creation, accidental data leaks, or the introduction of insecure code.
- **Severity**: Medium to High
- **Impact**: If a member accidentally creates a public repository, it could expose sensitive information. Additionally, this could lead to disorganization within the repositories and difficulty managing security risks.
- **Recommendation**: Limit repository creation permissions to admins or a designated group of trusted users. Regular members should only have read or write access, depending on their role.
