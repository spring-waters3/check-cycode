### Security Note: Default Member Permissions Allow Repository Creation

- **Description**: By default, members of the "spring-waters" organization have the ability to create repositories. While this aligns with GitHub's standard permission model, it introduces the potential risk of members unintentionally creating public repositories or repositories with insecure code.
- **Severity**: Low to Medium
- **Impact**: The ability for all members to create repositories could lead to accidental exposure of sensitive information or create repositories that do not follow the organization's security protocols.
- **Recommendation**: It is recommended to restrict repository creation to admins or specific trusted members. Alternatively, implementing a **monitoring process** for newly created repositories can help ensure compliance with organizational security policies.
